## Data
I have downloaded the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production) in a CSV file. I converted this into a JSON file.
The data shows, per country:
- what kinds of food are produced
- whether this food is actually food (for humans) or feed (for livestock)
- the amount produced per year (in 1000 tonnes) from 1961 to 2013
