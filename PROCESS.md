## Day 1
I downloaded the data and decided to convert it into a JSON file. I had to decide which columns to keep and which to discard, I dropped the area code, area, item code, element code, unit, latitude, and longitude. The information contained in these columns wasn't relevant for my visualization.  

## Day 2
I had my first mentor meeting today. I decided to split up the data since the file is so big. I will have a JSON file for each country as the bar chart and pie chart only need data for one country. For the world map I will make a JSON file that contains all countries and the total food produced in each year.
I have also decided that for the years I will start with a dropdown button instead of a slider since a slider would load a lot of data while sliding whereas it will be quicker to just click on a year as that will only load the data for that specific year.
