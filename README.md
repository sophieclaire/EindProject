# Food production around the World and over the years

The world population keeps on growing, in 2050 it is expected to rise to 9.7 billion.
Food is finite and its production has a huge impact on the environment. Production efficiency is key in this regard.
Not only do many countries produce food for their citizens, but also for their livestock: feed.
This visualization shows how much food each country produces and which percentage of this goes to humans (actual food), and which percentage goes to animals (feed).
