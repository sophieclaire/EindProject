# [Food production around the World and over the years](https://sophieclaire.github.io/project/code/HTML/index.html)

[My video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0iD2iGQh24&feature=youtu.be)

The world population keeps on growing, in 2050 it is expected to rise to 9.7 billion.
Food is finite and its production has a huge impact on the environment. Production efficiency is key in this regard.
Not only do many countries produce food for their citizens, but also for their livestock: feed. The livestock industry actually accounts for 14.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions! People are not usually aware of the extent of meat and feed production, and the extreme mpact this has on the environment. By seeing how much their country produces in terms of meat and feed, people may be encouraged to reduce their consumption of animal products, in order to try to diminish their impact on the environment.

This visualization shows how much food each country produces and which percentage of this goes to humans (actual food), and which percentage goes to animals (feed).
It includes a world map showing a country's total food plus feed production. There is also a button to change the year.

A piechart showing the distribution of food vs feed for that country.

A barchart showing the food or feed elements produced in that country. This includes a button to change the sorting order of the barchart.
