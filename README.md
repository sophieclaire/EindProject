# [Food production around the World and over the years](https://sophieclaire.github.io/project/code/HTML/index.html)

The world population keeps on growing, in 2050 it is expected to rise to 9.7 billion.
Food is finite and its production has a huge impact on the environment. Production efficiency is key in this regard.
Not only do many countries produce food for their citizens, but also for their livestock: feed.
This visualization shows how much food each country produces and which percentage of this goes to humans (actual food), and which percentage goes to animals (feed).
It includes a world map showing a country's total food plus feed production. There is also a button to change the year.

A piechart showing the distribution of food vs feed for that country.

A barchart showing the food or feed elements produced in that country. This includes a button to change the sorting order of the barchart.
