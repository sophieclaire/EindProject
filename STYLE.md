# Style Guide

## Comments
I will include comments above each function and above each group of code that serves the same purpose

## Indentation
I will use four spaces as indentation and no tabs.

## White lines
I will use one white line after the end of a function.
Within a function, the brackets ({}) will be on a new line by themselves.

## Variables and functions names
Function names will not contain capital letters.
Variable names may contain capital letters if they are composed of two or more words.

## Code grouping and organization
Each graph will have a seperate file with code.
Each function will serve a single purpose.
