        <p class="info">The world population keeps on growing, in 2050 it is expected to rise to 9.7 billion.
            Food is finite and its production has a huge impact on the environment. Production efficiency is key in this regard.
            Not only do many countries produce food for their citizens, but also for their livestock:
            feed. It is interesting to see which countries produce the most food in general, and also which countries produce the most feed, these are not necessrily the same.
            Most countries have meat production in their top 10 foods they produce the most, however, to produce this amount of meat, much more feed is needed. The livestock industry is actually responsible for about 14.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions.
            Perhaps focusing more on the production of food besides meat, and so less on feed, could decrease overall production and thus the environmental impact.

        <h3 style="color: #073983;"> Suggestions </h3>
        <p class="info">To my readers I suggest reducing their intake of dairy and meat as to drive down demand for animal products and consequentially decrease suppy. Try to eat more fish and plant based proteins such as legumes.
            Furthermore, you could swapcow dairy for plant based dairy such as soy, oat  or almond products, these have a much lower environmental impact.
            Every little change helps!
